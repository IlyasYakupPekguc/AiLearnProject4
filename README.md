Contents of the readme: 
1- How and what the goal exactly is of my journey.
2- About the project and what it does in short (the summary).
3- Notes i take while learning , and notes about the code. 
4- Error and problems i faced and how i fixed them.
5- My thoughts about the project at the end of the project and what i plan to do next.
6- HighLights of the course.


1----------------------------------------- THE GOAL EXPLAINED IN DETAILS:

First of all i'm a second grade student at Gazi University. I want to see what ai is about and learn more about the subject. This is my official Fifth project about ai. My first experience was within a compition named Teknofest. Agter gaining interest in AI i'm willing to learn more about this topic and i think the best way to do that is through projects. So this is my Fourth YouTube based project. While learning i also intend to get a fuller GitHub page. So that's a double win-win. After finishing the project i intend to continue the YouTube playlist if it apeals to me and my goals.

2----------------------------------------- THE SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT:
Just a basic classification project. First we take a few pics with our webcam and after that we classifiy each object that we show on the picture.
The model then classifies each object.


3----------------------------------------- CODING NOTES:
Where to start, 
I slowly start to understand coding AI with python mare and more by each project. It's still pretty complicated for me though as it is a very big an complex subject.
But i know that in like 6 months if i keep up with my pace is that i will become a better devoloper on the subject AI. By just practicing and learning more and more
i gain new information and learn new things about AI.

4----------------------------------------- ERRORS:
Ä± had a lot of misspelling errors that i need to look out for.


5----------------------------------------- THOUGHTS:
Future recomendation:
add more classes to the gui and play a little with the project. 


6----------------------------------------- HIGHLIGHTS:
-Classes
-What does self stand for?
+When you set a parameter for a class, the parameter is going to be thrown in as the w-first parameter of the function in that class. 
+EX.: 

Class lol
  def __something__(self)
      self.levelUp

player  = lol.something
the player is the first argument that is thrown in the something function.

def __something__(PLAYER)

Something like this.

-Functions
Like consturctors, init function, the slef keyword, and manymore.

-Understanding the libraries better and what each library stands for.
